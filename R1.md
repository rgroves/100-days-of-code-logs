## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode

**Start Date: 2020-03-22**
**End Date: TBD**

---

### Day 1: Sunday, March 22, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

Started a round-robin tournament scheduler app using React.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Wanted to do this without using create-react-app.
- Feels like I'm off to a good start.
- In the future, create branches for each day's work to make linking to work easier (by just providing a link to the repo and branch, instead of each commit).

#### **Link to work:**

[Plump Robin - A Round-Robin Tournament Scheduler](https://github.com/rgroves/plump-robin)

- [Initial commit](https://github.com/rgroves/plump-robin/commit/5c61a259e361bb2349c7891bc6165f3efb8e58ff)
- [Add base HTML skeleton file.](https://github.com/rgroves/plump-robin/commit/15a86dc4f20dff7ed8ddb0dedc7a03e107b95a5c)

---

### Day 2: Monday, March 23, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

Implemented round-robin schedule generation and display.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Only works with even teams at this point. Need to add a "bye" competitor if odd number of competitors are provided.
- Next steps should be to spend time getting things to look nice (styling).
- Code needs to be reorganized/refactored.
  - Need to find best practices around orgnaization of things when not using tooling.
    (though my guess is that tooling helps with this and being able to easily manage separate files per component)
- I implemented the round-robin algorithm from the text description on the [Round-robin_tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament#Scheduling_algorithm) Wikipedia page.

#### **Link to work:**

[Plump Robin - A Round-Robin Tournament Scheduler](https://github.com/rgroves/plump-robin)

- I forgot to add a branch for the day's work so this was the first commit:
  - [Add functionality to display a (mocked) schedule.](https://github.com/rgroves/plump-robin/commit/0a54b98b35912f401e3ecf47e33ce04b2b7c6a0c)
- The rest of the day's work was committed to [Today's Branch](https://github.com/rgroves/plump-robin/commits/20200323-work)

---

### Day 3: Tuesday, March 24, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

Added some content to the page and made it look and behave a bit better. Still needs work, but progress!

#### **Thoughts:**

- I need to get more familiar with Bootstrap. It felt like I took too much time getting even the basic styling I have in place.
- I like coming up with a design from scratch the least. Things are much easier when you're given a design to implement. Props to all y'all UX designers out there.
- Next steps: need to continue improving the UI more.

---

### Day 4: Wednesday, March 25, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- More styling goodness.
- A little code cleanup (removing console logs)
- Added user feedback for bad interactions (add without entering name; trying to generate schedule without enough info)

#### **Thoughts:**

- Need to tweak design for larger screen sizes (add some flex to the areas and single center column for main content).
- Need to add functionality to reset and start over
- Want to look into using D3 library to show the rounds as competition brackets/graph
- I still don't feel great about coming up with my own design (even with Bootstrap's immense help).

---

### Day 5: Thursday, March 26, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Did some code reorganization. Things were getting too cluttered in one JS file.
- Worked on UI and styling more.
  - Added some flex goodness.
  - Getting to a point where I'm starting to like the direction the UI is going.
  - Still work to be done though.
- Made it easier to add competitors (allow comma-separated list)

#### **Thoughts:**

- Next up:
  - Add functionality to reset and start over
  - More design tweaks likely
- The D3 thing from yesterday didn't make sense, because this isn't a single elimination style tourney generator where a bracket system can be used... but maybe that can be a future option.

---

### Day 6: Friday, March 27, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Fixed bugs introduced in last session around allowing comma-separated list of competitor names
- Added additional bad form interaction feedback
- Continued work on UI styling
  - Added even more flex goodness!
  - Now looks better at larger device sizes

#### **Thoughts:**

- Still need to add functionality to reset and start over
- Also need functionality to edit and remove names
- Found this [Bootstrap cheatsheet](https://hackerthemes.com/bootstrap-cheatsheet/) extremely helpful
- Also this [flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) is a nice go-to reference

---

### Day 7: Saturday, March 28, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

I implemented functionality for resetting and removing competitors.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Need to rethink things in order to be able to reset the schedule when the competitors are reset or removed.
- Still need functionality to allow user to edit names.
- There was less done on this project today because I was preparing a session for the freeCodeCamp Chicago Local Study Group meetup tomorrow‚ÄîI'll be walking members through building a little advice generator web app.
  - I also wrote code for this but it's not up on GitHub at the moment, I'll link it after tomorrow's study group session.

### Day 8: Sunday, March 29, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Small amount of refactoring in the Plump Robin app.
- Led freeCodeCamp Chicago Local Study Group in build out of a small web app for practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

#### **Thoughts:**

### Day 9: Monday, March 30, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

I worked on polishing the project I built for the freeCodeCamp Chicago Local Study Group meetup yesterday.

#### **Thoughts:**

- This design, while I'm sure there are technical design flaws in it, I actually like. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Plan to continue building out Plump Robin tomorrow.

---

### Day 10: Tuesday, March 31, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Switched back to working on the Plump Robin app.
- I was able to refactor things nicely so that a reset would also clear the schedule.
- Simplified flow for users with on-the-fly schedule generation as competitors are added/removed.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Still need functionality to allow user to edit names. Will tackle this tomorrow.
- Almost finished with this, time to start thinking about what I'll do next.

### Day 11: Wednesday, April 1, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Decided to hold off on the Plump Robin project for now.
- Going to knock out the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design projects, starting with the Tribute Page.

#### **Thoughts:**

- I've been putting off the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design projects for the longest time now.
- I'm trying to face my fear of having poor design skills and do more projects that force me to learn and flex design skills.
- I was reading some articles on [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) and am really inspired.
- I will circle back to the Plump Robin project after I tackle the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design projects.

---

### Day 12: Thursday, April 2, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Fleshed out content of Tribute Page project.
- Used content from Wikipedia and figured out how to correctly (i.e. legally) use it with proper attribution.
- Reviewed material from bigmachine.io: Coding Interview Bootcamp on Big-O notation.
  - It's been a while since I've reviewed/memorized this stuff and since I'll be ramping up my job search soon, gotta prep for those interviews!

#### **Thoughts:**

- Not much progress today.
- Looking for design inspiration for this tribute page.
- Hope to finish populating the content/copy and getting basic mobile-first styling in place tomorrow.

### Day 13: Friday, April 3, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

I continued working on the freeCodeCamp Tribute Page project. A lot of time was
spent just exploring for a direction to take in terms of design/styling of the
page. I think I landed on a direction I'm taking off in. I just started with
some of the mobile-first (default) styling. Need some additional content and
images, then will continue fleshing out the design. I'll also need to work on
the media query tweaks for larger screens/devices.

#### **Thoughts:**

- I did some reading of design articles on SmashingMagazine.com. My main
  thought‚Äîthere's reading about and seeing great looking designs... and then
  there's actually coming up with one of your own. üòü
- Without a design/mockup I could probably go back-and-forth forever trying to
  get things to "look good".
- I will persist. üí™üèª

### Day 14: Saturday, April 4, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Learned about CSS shapes today and applied a technique to the Tribute page I'm working on.
- Reviewed more material from bigmachine.io: Data Structures: Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly)
- Did some reading: Cracking the Coding Interview ‚Äî Intro & Chapter 1.

### Day 15: Sunday, April 5, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- I ran today's session for the freeCodeCamp Chicago Local Study Group where we
  practiced CSS & JavaScript concepts.
- I continued making progress on the Tribute page project.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Small mobile design for tribute page almost complete, need to create more
  copy/content for the design to work as intended. Not sure if that is a good
  or bad thing. Then will finalized mid and large screen designs and will move
  on to the next project. Almost there! I think. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Day 16: Monday, April 6, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- I'm still playing around with the design of the Tribute page.
- I realized today that the idea I had breaks down when a user has their font
  size adjusted in the browser settings. I need to rethink and probably simplify.
- Did some reading: Cracking the Coding Interview ‚Äî Chapter 2.

#### **Thoughts:**

- A bit frustrated that I didn't make more progress today.
- Not the best mental health today. Stress levels high. Breathing in, breathing
  out. Dealing.

### Day 21: Saturday, April 11, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- More work on survey form: passed remaining tests; began styling.

#### **Thoughts:**

---

### Day 22: Sunday, April 12, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Continued working on Survey Form project, tweaking the form styling into
  something that looks good.

#### **Thoughts:**

- I like the direction it's heading in, but it still needs more work.
- I may have went overboard with the CSS reset I used, but it's forcing me to
  learn more about the concerns involved with styling input/form components.

### Day 23: Monday, April 13, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Continued working on Survey Form project, more form styling.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Styling long text for checkboxes proving to be tricky.
- Making hit targets larger (extending full length of line) for short button
  text also seems to be tricky.
- Hoping to finsih this project tomorrow and move on to the next one.

### Day 24: Tuesday, April 14, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Today was a codeless day.
- Spent time watching and supporting freeCodeCamp's Lockdown Conference.
- Spent time learning about CSS positioning (position: relative|absolute|fixed|static).
- Spent time examining sites that use the CSS fixed position elements.
- Spent time on job search items.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Will get back on track and into code tomorrow.

---

### Day 25: Wednesday, April 15, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Jumped back to the Tribute Page project for a change of pace.
- Because I was spending time deep diving into forms and accessibility I
  decided to look back on my Tribute Page project with accessibility in mind.
- Managed to find and fix a few issues using the W3C Validation and the AChecker
  Services.
- Used TalkBack on my Pixel 2 to navigate the page checking the screenreader
  experience, and managed to tweak a few things based on that.

#### **Thoughts:**

- I need to keep Accessibility in mind as part of the build and testing process
  going forward.

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Ran across this [Build a PAC-MAN game in JS, HTML, and CSS game project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeUGlSl2i4Q) today.
- Followed along with tutorial, but in the end made many tweaks and additions to the logic and style.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Today was a guilty pleasure day. Tomorrow back to freeCodeCamp curriculum projects.

### Day 27: Friday, April 17, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Switched back to working on the freeCodeCamp Survey Form project.
- Still trying to nail down a decent basic design that I like.
- Wrestling with styling the form controls, the CSS reset I used knocked out a lot of the visual look of controls.
- Looking at this as an opportunity to better get to know what goes into the styling of form inputs.

#### **Thoughts:**

- This project has been dragging out, but I'm proud of myself for just sticking with it, even through all of the
  back and forth on the design decisions.
- Not all projects are fun and games or super interesting, but still have to see them through to the end...
- Hopefully, that end will be soon for this one. LOL

### Day 28: Saturday, April 18, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Re-created the CSS from scratch taking a more organized approach.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Passing all tests and looking pretty good, so I'm calling this project finished.
- Form can use a little more Portlandia visuals and more inside jokes. Keeping this note as a future project.
- Moving on to next freeCodeCamp project tomorrow.

### Day 29: Sunday, April 19, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- I ran today's session for the freeCodeCamp Chicago Local Study Group where we
  practiced project collaboration with git and GitHub.
- I started working on the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Product Landing Page project.

#### **Thoughts:**

### Day 30: Monday, April 20, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Continued work on Product Landing Page project, adding some basic structure
  to the page in order to pass some of the content tests in the freeCodeCamp
  test suite.
- Also continued working through "Cracking the Coding Interview" book.
  - Fleshing out my Interview Preparation Grid

#### **Thoughts:**

- Decided to use Bootstrap for this project which should speed up the build
  process since I can rely on the design styles provided the Bootstrap library.
- I really wish I had kept a developer journal documenting my journey of 25+ years
  as a developer. Trying to remember some of the big wins, failures, things
  I've learned, etc. over the course of a career is proving to be difficult.
- Lesson learned‚Äîwill be starting a developer journal ASAP.

### Day 31: Tuesday, April 21, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Slight detour today to work through [How to Build a Multiplayer Card Game with Phaser 3, Express, and Socket.IO](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-multiplayer-card-game-with-phaser-3-express-and-socket-io/)
- Learned about Phaser and Socket.io
- Also built out the Socket.io example chat app.
- Made more notes for fleshing out my resume and interview prep.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Phaser looks like a really neat HTML5 game library.
- Need to get back to freeCodeCamp projects tomorrow, so will have to revisit Phaser.

### Day 32: Wednesday, April 22, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Back to working on the product landing page project.
- All tests are passing, just need to make it look good now.
- Made some progress on the header/nav menu, but still have more work to do there.

#### **Thoughts:**

- I always feel like I'm fighting with it whenever I try to use Bootstrap. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

---

### Day 33: Thursday, April 23, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- I continued my work on the product landing page project.

#### **Thoughts:**

- I know why I put off these responsive web design projects so long. Trying to
  come up with designs that look good to me is a pain and stresses me out a bit
  if I'm being honest about it.
- Working with Bootstrap is also not fun for me. I'm guessing this is because I
  don't know it well enough‚ÄîI need to deep dive into it more, but part of me
  just wants to use my own CSS.
- Ran up against a problem with the position:fixed navbar where I thought it
  wasn't respecting the min-width rule on the body. Didn't realize (though it
  totally makes sense to me now) that because fixed is a type of absolute
  positioning, it gets taken out of the document flow and therefore has to have
  it's own min-width rule applied to it. Something to remember in the future
  so it doesn't trip me up again.

### Day 34: Friday, April 24, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Working through "Bootstrap 4 for the Developer" by Mario Duilio Macari on Pluralsight.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Decided to hold off on the Product Landing Page project to work through the
  doc and some supplementary material to get a better handle on Bootstrap.

### Day 35: Saturday, April 25, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Continued working through "Bootstrap 4 for the Developer" by Mario Duilio Macari on Pluralsight.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Sticking with this course even though the way the content is presented isn't
  the greatest. (Seems comments in the course discussion kind of agree, glad
  it's just not me.)

### Day 36: Sunday, April 26, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- I ran today's session for the freeCodeCamp Chicago Local Study Group where we
  practiced JavaScript by working through the Basic Algorithm Scripting
  challenges on the freeCodeCamp website together.
- Also continued working through "Bootstrap 4 for the Developer" by Mario
  Duilio Macari on Pluralsight:
  - Graphic Design and Responsive Layouts - Alignment and Offsets

#### **Thoughts:**

- Received kudos from two of the memebers of the freeCodeCamp Chicago Local
  Study Group today regarding how useful today's session was. I'm extremely
  grateful for the opportunity to lead the group and it makes me really happy
  that I am able to help others in their journey to becoming successful
  developers.

### Day 37: Monday, April 27, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Opened [this issue](https://github.com/auth0/node-auth0/issues/479) in the auth0/node-auth0 repository
  - Waiting for feedback from project maintainers.
- Did a little work on the freeCodeCamp Landing Page project as well.

#### **Thoughts:**

- The issue with node-auth0 came up in the Chicago Tech Slack so I decided to
  submit an official Issue and potential PR for it.
- Feeling a bit more comfortable with Bootstrap just after partially going
  through that Pluralsight course, so jumped back to the Landing Page project
  for a bit today.

#### **Link to work:**

- node-auth0

  - Committed potential fixes for issue noted above in a [fix branch of my fork](https://github.com/rgroves/node-auth0/commits/fix/bad-data-check-logic)
    which I will create a PR for if the issue is accepted.

### Day 38: Tuesday, April 28, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Completed course "Bootstrap 4 for the Developer" by Mario Duilio Macari on Pluralsight
- Completed course ["Web Layouts with Flexbox and Bootstrap 4" by Jeff Batt on Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/web-layouts-flexbox-bootstrap-4)

#### **Thoughts:**

- Did complete watching the material in the "Bootstrap 4 for the Developer" but stopped working through the examples, since they weren't really presented in a way that lent itself to incremental work, it was more like just reviewing all the options in the Bootstrap documentation. Was kind of a pain to get through the way it was presented, but I digress.

- I had more luck with the other Bootstrap course, which while only focused on Flexbox in Bootstrap still touched on other useful things in Bootstrap and was presented really well.

- Tomorrow will go back and complete the Product Landing Page armed with more knowledge of Bootstrap and less of a bad mental attitude toward it.

### Day 39: Wednesday, April 29, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Made good progress on the product landing page project.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Just need a few more tweaks to the product landing page and I'll call it finished.

### Day 40: Thursday, April 30, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Completed the freeCodeCamp Product Landing Page project.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Only two more freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design projects to go.
- I've put off the Responsive Web Design projects for so long because while I
  enjoy coding up pages, I did not enjoy designing them myself.
- I feel the practice is paying off though so getting these done is totally
  worth it for me.

### Day 41: Friday, May 1, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Played with freeCodeCamp's beta Python curriculum
- Created my repo for the next Responsive Web Design project, Technical Documentation Page
  - Still need to decide what I'll be doing doc for.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Today was a slow progress day, but that's okay.

### Day 42: Saturday, May 2, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Created placeholder content for the Technical Documentation Page project. Passing almost half the tests. Will knockout the others tomorrow and start really fleshing out the content before moving onto the styling.
- Learned about the :placeholder-shown pseudo-selectors
- Learned ::before and ::after pseudo-selectors aren't available for input elements
- Learned that if you create an empty repo on github, clone it, create a branch not named master and start commiting there, then your repo will have no master branch. (i.e. master is just a normal branch nothing special about it except that it is created by default on first commit unless you create a branch explicitly)

#### **Thoughts:**

- Day 42! Don't Panic.
- So close to the finish line with the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design (RWD) projects.
- Since I've already worked through the bulk of the freeCodeCamp curriculum I'll be able to pick up the Responsive Web Design and JavaScript Certifications, and I'm waiting until after I complete the RWD projects‚Äîeven though I could have picked up the JavaScript one for a long while now.
- I never thought much about actually grabbing the certifications because I was more onboard for just learning new (and brushing up on existing) stuff.
- Now that I'm leading a freeCodeCamp Local Study Group I feel like I should have the certs now as a way to lead by example.
- Looking forward to moving on to the Front-End Libraries projects once I have the RWD ones completed.
- Feeling like I have good momentum so trying my hardest to keep it going and not break the 100 continuous days of code. Even though some days were less than optimal I still did something to keep the progress going.

### Day 43: Sunday, May 3, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- I ran today's session for the freeCodeCamp Chicago Local Study Group where we
  practiced JavaScript by working through more of the Basic Algorithm Scripting
  challenges on the freeCodeCamp website together and walked through some of the
  JavaScript curriculum since today's attendees had limited exposure to JS.
- Continued work on the Technical Documentation Page‚Äîall tests are passing
  just need to style and flesh out the content.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Should knock out the technical doc page tomorrow. W00T!

---

### Day 44: Monday, May 4, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- I was able to get the bulk of the styling finished on the Technical Documentation Page project.
- Did not get to fleshing out the content yet, so that will be for tomorrow.

#### **Thoughts:**

- I probably should have picked a more "code" centric topic, but I'll make this
  work.
- Learned a useful technique for making part of a grid container sticky and
  how to test for funcionality support with a media query.

---

### Day 45: Tuesday, May 5, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Started fleshing out the content of the Technical Documentation Page, but
  nowhere near complete. Will continue with it tomorrow.
- Reviewed and gave feedback for a Tribute Page project built by a member of the
  freeCodeCamp Chicago Local Study Group and helped someone out in the
  CodeBuddies Slack.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Kind of feel like I didn't really code today since I had the HTML & CSS
  already laid out and it was mostly working on the content of the page.
- At least I reviewed some code for others. I'll let that count for today.
- I clearly underestimated the time it would take me to write out clear and
  straightforward documentation on number systems. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- I'll keep pushing until this is completed. Can't wait to tackle the last
  freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design project, the Personal Portfolio Webpage.

### Day 46: Wednesday, May 6, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Attended freeCodeCamp Chicago Local Study Groups first "Active Office Hours" hosted by Deanna
  - Provided insight, answered questions, and worked through a freeCodeCamp
    Intermediate JavaScript Algorithms problem for the group.
- Wanted to learn more about CSS gradients so started a CodePen exploring and
  documenting examples.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Took a break from the Technical Documentation Page project today.
- TBH that project was wearing on me a bit as I don't find it interesting
  enough‚Äîbut I will persist... tomorrow!

### Day 47: Thursday, May 7, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- More progress on Technical Documentation Page project.
  - Wrote more copy for the contents of the documentation.
  - Began implementing a pure CSS toggleable menu for mobile.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Great CSS practice today with learning about toggleable menus with only CSS (no JS)!

### Day 48: Friday, May 8, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Still working on Technical Documentation Page project
  - Update similar to yesterday, still writing copy for documentation page contents.
  - Started cleaning up the hack of a mess I started with the toggleable mobile menu.

#### **Thoughts:**

- This project has been slow going. I think it's due to my lack of interest in
  writing copy versus actually getting to build something.
- Need to power through this over the weekend and get it wrapped up so I can
  finally tackle the last Responsive Web Design project.
- The Front-End and API Cert projects will surely hold my interest more than
  the Responsive Web Dev ones.

---

### Day 50: Sunday, May 10, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Worked on Technical Documentation Page project.
  - Three sections down, three sections to go.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Writing the doc pages is the time consuming part of this project.
- Still need to tweak nav menu and spacing a bit. Focusing on completeing
  content first.
- Mother's Day weekend left time a little short, so didn't get as much work in
  on the project as I'd hoped.
- Halfway to 100 days! Time flies when you're having fun. ‚åö‚úà

### Day 52: Tuesday, May 12, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Worked on Technical Documentation Page project.
  - All sections written. Now need to edit copy, tweak styles, and ensure code
    validates.
- Worked through 2 hours of the Advanced JavaScript course by Kyle Simpson on
  Pluralsight.

#### **Thoughts:**

- So close to the end of the Technical Documentation Page project! I'll be
  really happy when this one is finally complete.

### Day 53: Wednesday, May 13, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Wrapping up the Technical Documentation Page project.

#### **Thoughts:**

- The Tech Doc project could be called done, but I want to add some polish
  to it because I'm not too happy with it in the looks department.

### Day 54: Thursday, May 14, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Started on freeCodeCamp Personal Portfolio project, the last project required
  for completing the Responsive Web Design Curriculum.
- Fiddled on CodePen a bit: reviewed my [linear-gradient examples](https://codepen.io/robertgroves/full/wvKpdQQ),
  created a [CodePen using Progressbar.js](https://codepen.io/robertgroves/full/OJyovBp)
  a library I found through [another freeCodeCamp member](https://twitter.com/bradleyhop1/status/1260772528064167938))

#### **Thoughts:**

- Didn't press for getting a lot done today, had other priorities I needed to
  attend to and felt I needed to slow down a bit in between projects for my own
  mental health.
- Learned about [Progressbar.js](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/progressbar.js)
  today‚Äîa neat library for custom SVG progress bars.

### Day 55: Friday, May 15, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Went back through a couple of my projects to clean things up a bit.
  - Made sure they all reported green in W3C Validator
- Made a small effort on the Portfolio page‚Äînot much progress‚Äîgetting some of
  the content structure in place, passing a few tests.

#### **Thoughts:**

- I'm glad I took my own advice and ran my projects through the W3C HTML
  validator. I've been telling people this in our Local Study Group and in the
  fCC forums for a while now. Need to make this part of my project flow, maybe
  with some other validators for a11y too.

### Day 57: Sunday, May 17, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Led freeCodeCamp Chicago Local Study Group where the goal was to build out
  our own individual projects without following a tutorial, but instead use
  documentation, samples, and asking questions.
- I started building out a "Lottery Pool" app, but didn't get as far as I
  had hoped in the 3 hours we had for the session.

#### **Thoughts:**

- I was able to get up and running with MongoDB Atlas, but stumbled a bit
  setting up the node app to work with the database using the mongodb module.

### Day 58: Monday, May 18, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Completed working through the remainder of the Advanced JavaScript course by
  Kyle Simpson on Pluralsight.
  - Practiced with objects/behavior delegation and async patterns
    (generators & promises).
- Started MongoDB University's Developer Learning Path: MongoDB Basics
- Did a little work on the Number Pool API‚Äîjust getting the MongoDB connection
  issues I had yesterday worked out (success)!

#### **Thoughts:**

- Need more practice with generators and promises. I get it, but it doesn't seem
  to come naturally. With more practice it will hopefully become second nature.
- I seem to have forgotten most of what I know about MongoDB by not using it
  in so long. Working on correcting that by going through MongoDB University's
  Developer Learning Path.

### Day 59: Tuesday, May 19, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Jumped back working on the freeCodeCamp Personal Portfolio page so I don't lose sight of that.
- Continued through MongoDB University's Developer Learning Path: MongoDB Basics

#### **Thoughts:**

- I let myself get sidetracked a bit from the excitement of building out the
  project started at our freeCodeCamp Chicago Local Study Group session last
  Sunday.
- Need to direct focus back to my primary goal which was completing the
  freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design curriculum.

#### **Today's Progress**:

- More work on the Personal Portfolio Page project.
- Spent time prepping for tomorrow's freeCodeCamp Chicago Local Study Group's
  session celebrating the group's 1-year anniversary.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Only a couple of small commits, but there was a lot of experimenting with look
  and feel that I'm not quite happy with so time spent on this today (and other
  days for sure) should not be judged based on commits.
