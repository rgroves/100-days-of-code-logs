## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode

**Start Date: 2020-03-22**
**End Date: TBD**

---

### Day 1: Sunday, March 22, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

Started a round-robin tournament scheduler app using React.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Wanted to do this without using create-react-app.
- Feels like I'm off to a good start.
- In the future, create branches for each day's work to make linking to work easier (by just providing a link to the repo and branch, instead of each commit).
