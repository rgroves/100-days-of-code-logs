## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode

**Start Date: 2020-03-22**
**End Date: TBD**

---

### Day 1: Sunday, March 22, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

Started a round-robin tournament scheduler app using React.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Wanted to do this without using create-react-app.
- Feels like I'm off to a good start.
- In the future, create branches for each day's work to make linking to work easier (by just providing a link to the repo and branch, instead of each commit).

#### **Link to work:**

### Day 2: Monday, March 23, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

Implemented round-robin schedule generation and display.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Only works with even teams at this point. Need to add a "bye" competitor if odd number of competitors are provided.
- Next steps should be to spend time getting things to look nice (styling).
- Code needs to be reorganized/refactored.
  - Need to find best practices around orgnaization of things when not using tooling.
    (though my guess is that tooling helps with this and being able to easily manage separate files per component)
- I implemented the round-robin algorithm from the text description on the [Round-robin_tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament#Scheduling_algorithm) Wikipedia page.

- I forgot to add a branch for the day's work so this was the first commit:
  - [Add functionality to display a (mocked) schedule.](https://github.com/rgroves/plump-robin/commit/0a54b98b35912f401e3ecf47e33ce04b2b7c6a0c)
- The rest of the day's work was committed to [Today's Branch](https://github.com/rgroves/plump-robin/commits/20200323-work)

### Day 3: Tuesday, March 24, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

Added some content to the page and made it look and behave a bit better. Still needs work, but progress!

#### **Thoughts:**

- I need to get more familiar with Bootstrap. It felt like I took too much time getting even the basic styling I have in place.
- I like coming up with a design from scratch the least. Things are much easier when you're given a design to implement. Props to all y'all UX designers out there.
- Next steps: need to continue improving the UI more.

### Day 4: Wednesday, March 25, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- More styling goodness.
- A little code cleanup (removing console logs)
- Added user feedback for bad interactions (add without entering name; trying to generate schedule without enough info)

#### **Thoughts:**

- Need to tweak design for larger screen sizes (add some flex to the areas and single center column for main content).
- Need to add functionality to reset and start over
- Want to look into using D3 library to show the rounds as competition brackets/graph
- I still don't feel great about coming up with my own design (even with Bootstrap's immense help).

### Day 5: Thursday, March 26, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Did some code reorganization. Things were getting too cluttered in one JS file.
- Worked on UI and styling more.
  - Added some flex goodness.
  - Getting to a point where I'm starting to like the direction the UI is going.
  - Still work to be done though.
- Made it easier to add competitors (allow comma-separated list)

#### **Thoughts:**

- Next up:
  - Add functionality to reset and start over
  - More design tweaks likely
- The D3 thing from yesterday didn't make sense, because this isn't a single elimination style tourney generator where a bracket system can be used... but maybe that can be a future option.

### Day 6: Friday, March 27, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Fixed bugs introduced in last session around allowing comma-separated list of competitor names
- Added additional bad form interaction feedback
- Continued work on UI styling
  - Added even more flex goodness!
  - Now looks better at larger device sizes

#### **Thoughts:**

- Still need to add functionality to reset and start over
- Also need functionality to edit and remove names
- Found this [Bootstrap cheatsheet](https://hackerthemes.com/bootstrap-cheatsheet/) extremely helpful
- Also this [flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) is a nice go-to reference

### Day 7: Saturday, March 28, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

I implemented functionality for resetting and removing competitors.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Need to rethink things in order to be able to reset the schedule when the competitors are reset or removed.
- Still need functionality to allow user to edit names.
- There was less done on this project today because I was preparing a session for the freeCodeCamp Chicago Local Study Group meetup tomorrow‚ÄîI'll be walking members through building a little advice generator web app.
  - I also wrote code for this but it's not up on GitHub at the moment, I'll link it after tomorrow's study group session.

### Day 8: Sunday, March 29, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Small amount of refactoring in the Plump Robin app.
- Led freeCodeCamp Chicago Local Study Group in build out of a small web app for practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

#### **Thoughts:**

- Need to loop back and handle previous listed to do items.

### Day 9: Monday, March 30, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

I worked on polishing the project I built for the freeCodeCamp Chicago Local Study Group meetup yesterday.

#### **Thoughts:**

- This design, while I'm sure there are technical design flaws in it, I actually like. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Plan to continue building out Plump Robin tomorrow.
