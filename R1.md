## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode

**Start Date: 2020-03-22**
**End Date: TBD**

### Day 1: Sunday, March 22, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

Started a round-robin tournament scheduler app using React.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Wanted to do this without using create-react-app.
- Feels like I'm off to a good start.
- In the future, create branches for each day's work to make linking to work easier (by just providing a link to the repo and branch, instead of each commit).

### Day 2: Monday, March 23, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

Implemented round-robin schedule generation and display.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Only works with even teams at this point. Need to add a "bye" competitor if odd number of competitors are provided.
- Next steps should be to spend time getting things to look nice (styling).
- Code needs to be reorganized/refactored.
  - Need to find best practices around orgnaization of things when not using tooling.
    (though my guess is that tooling helps with this and being able to easily manage separate files per component)
- I implemented the round-robin algorithm from the text description on the [Round-robin_tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament#Scheduling_algorithm) Wikipedia page.

- I forgot to add a branch for the day's work so this was the first commit:
  - [Add functionality to display a (mocked) schedule.](https://github.com/rgroves/plump-robin/commit/0a54b98b35912f401e3ecf47e33ce04b2b7c6a0c)
- The rest of the day's work was committed to [Today's Branch](https://github.com/rgroves/plump-robin/commits/20200323-work)

### Day 3: Tuesday, March 24, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

Added some content to the page and made it look and behave a bit better. Still needs work, but progress!

#### **Thoughts:**

- I need to get more familiar with Bootstrap. It felt like I took too much time getting even the basic styling I have in place.
- I like coming up with a design from scratch the least. Things are much easier when you're given a design to implement. Props to all y'all UX designers out there.
- Next steps: need to continue improving the UI more.

### Day 4: Wednesday, March 25, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- More styling goodness.
- A little code cleanup (removing console logs)
- Added user feedback for bad interactions (add without entering name; trying to generate schedule without enough info)

#### **Thoughts:**

- Need to tweak design for larger screen sizes (add some flex to the areas and single center column for main content).
- Need to add functionality to reset and start over
- Want to look into using D3 library to show the rounds as competition brackets/graph
- I still don't feel great about coming up with my own design (even with Bootstrap's immense help).
