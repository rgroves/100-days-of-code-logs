## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode

**Start Date: 2020-03-22**
**End Date: TBD**

---

### Day 1: Sunday, March 22, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

Started a round-robin tournament scheduler app using React.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Wanted to do this without using create-react-app.
- Feels like I'm off to a good start.
- In the future, create branches for each day's work to make linking to work easier (by just providing a link to the repo and branch, instead of each commit).

#### **Link to work:**

[Plump Robin - A Round-Robin Tournament Scheduler](https://github.com/rgroves/plump-robin)

- [Initial commit](https://github.com/rgroves/plump-robin/commit/5c61a259e361bb2349c7891bc6165f3efb8e58ff)
- [Add base HTML skeleton file.](https://github.com/rgroves/plump-robin/commit/15a86dc4f20dff7ed8ddb0dedc7a03e107b95a5c)

---

### Day 2: Monday, March 23, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

Implemented round-robin schedule generation and display.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Only works with even teams at this point. Need to add a "bye" competitor if odd number of competitors are provided.
- Next steps should be to spend time getting things to look nice (styling).
- Code needs to be reorganized/refactored.
  - Need to find best practices around orgnaization of things when not using tooling.
    (though my guess is that tooling helps with this and being able to easily manage separate files per component)
- I implemented the round-robin algorithm from the text description on the [Round-robin_tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament#Scheduling_algorithm) Wikipedia page.

#### **Link to work:**

[Plump Robin - A Round-Robin Tournament Scheduler](https://github.com/rgroves/plump-robin)

- I forgot to add a branch for the day's work so this was the first commit:
  - [Add functionality to display a (mocked) schedule.](https://github.com/rgroves/plump-robin/commit/0a54b98b35912f401e3ecf47e33ce04b2b7c6a0c)
- The rest of the day's work was committed to [Today's Branch](https://github.com/rgroves/plump-robin/commits/20200323-work)

---

### Day 3: Tuesday, March 24, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

Added some content to the page and made it look and behave a bit better. Still needs work, but progress!

#### **Thoughts:**

- I need to get more familiar with Bootstrap. It felt like I took too much time getting even the basic styling I have in place.
- I like coming up with a design from scratch the least. Things are much easier when you're given a design to implement. Props to all y'all UX designers out there.
- Next steps: need to continue improving the UI more.

---

### Day 4: Wednesday, March 25, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- More styling goodness.
- A little code cleanup (removing console logs)
- Added user feedback for bad interactions (add without entering name; trying to generate schedule without enough info)

#### **Thoughts:**

- Need to tweak design for larger screen sizes (add some flex to the areas and single center column for main content).
- Need to add functionality to reset and start over
- Want to look into using D3 library to show the rounds as competition brackets/graph
- I still don't feel great about coming up with my own design (even with Bootstrap's immense help).

---

### Day 5: Thursday, March 26, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Did some code reorganization. Things were getting too cluttered in one JS file.
- Worked on UI and styling more.
  - Added some flex goodness.
  - Getting to a point where I'm starting to like the direction the UI is going.
  - Still work to be done though.
- Made it easier to add competitors (allow comma-separated list)

#### **Thoughts:**

- Next up:
  - Add functionality to reset and start over
  - More design tweaks likely
- The D3 thing from yesterday didn't make sense, because this isn't a single elimination style tourney generator where a bracket system can be used... but maybe that can be a future option.

---

### Day 6: Friday, March 27, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Fixed bugs introduced in last session around allowing comma-separated list of competitor names
- Added additional bad form interaction feedback
- Continued work on UI styling
  - Added even more flex goodness!
  - Now looks better at larger device sizes

#### **Thoughts:**

- Still need to add functionality to reset and start over
- Also need functionality to edit and remove names
- Found this [Bootstrap cheatsheet](https://hackerthemes.com/bootstrap-cheatsheet/) extremely helpful
- Also this [flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) is a nice go-to reference

### Day 7: Saturday, March 28, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

I implemented functionality for resetting and removing competitors.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Need to rethink things in order to be able to reset the schedule when the competitors are reset or removed.
- Still need functionality to allow user to edit names.
- There was less done on this project today because I was preparing a session for the freeCodeCamp Chicago Local Study Group meetup tomorrow‚ÄîI'll be walking members through building a little advice generator web app.
  - I also wrote code for this but it's not up on GitHub at the moment, I'll link it after tomorrow's study group session.

### Day 8: Sunday, March 29, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Small amount of refactoring in the Plump Robin app.
- Led freeCodeCamp Chicago Local Study Group in build out of a small web app for practicing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Day 9: Monday, March 30, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

I worked on polishing the project I built for the freeCodeCamp Chicago Local Study Group meetup yesterday.

#### **Thoughts:**

- This design, while I'm sure there are technical design flaws in it, I actually like. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Plan to continue building out Plump Robin tomorrow.

---

### Day 10: Tuesday, March 31, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Switched back to working on the Plump Robin app.
- I was able to refactor things nicely so that a reset would also clear the schedule.
- Simplified flow for users with on-the-fly schedule generation as competitors are added/removed.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Still need functionality to allow user to edit names. Will tackle this tomorrow.
- Almost finished with this, time to start thinking about what I'll do next.

### Day 11: Wednesday, April 1, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Decided to hold off on the Plump Robin project for now.
- Going to knock out the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design projects, starting with the Tribute Page.

#### **Thoughts:**

- I've been putting off the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design projects for the longest time now.
- I'm trying to face my fear of having poor design skills and do more projects that force me to learn and flex design skills.
- I was reading some articles on [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) and am really inspired.
- I will circle back to the Plump Robin project after I tackle the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design projects.

Template text for copy & paste goodness:

### Day 12: Thursday, April 2, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Fleshed out content of Tribute Page project.
- Used content from Wikipedia and figured out how to correctly (i.e. legally) use it with proper attribution.
- Reviewed material from bigmachine.io: Coding Interview Bootcamp on Big-O notation.
  - It's been a while since I've reviewed/memorized this stuff and since I'll be ramping up my job search soon, gotta prep for those interviews!

#### **Thoughts:**

- Not much progress today.
- Looking for design inspiration for this tribute page.
- Hope to finish populating the content/copy and getting basic mobile-first styling in place tomorrow.

### Day 13: Friday, April 3, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

I continued working on the freeCodeCamp Tribute Page project. A lot of time was
spent just exploring for a direction to take in terms of design/styling of the
page. I think I landed on a direction I'm taking off in. I just started with
some of the mobile-first (default) styling. Need some additional content and
images, then will continue fleshing out the design. I'll also need to work on
the media query tweaks for larger screens/devices.

#### **Thoughts:**

- I did some reading of design articles on SmashingMagazine.com. My main
  thought‚Äîthere's reading about and seeing great looking designs... and then
  there's actually coming up with one of your own. üòü
- Without a design/mockup I could probably go back-and-forth forever trying to
  get things to "look good".
- I will persist. üí™üèª

### Day 14: Saturday, April 4, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Learned about CSS shapes today and applied a technique to the Tribute page I'm working on.
- Reviewed more material from bigmachine.io: Data Structures: Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly)
- Did some reading: Cracking the Coding Interview ‚Äî Intro & Chapter 1.

### Day 15: Sunday, April 5, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- I ran today's session for the freeCodeCamp Chicago Local Study Group where we
  practiced CSS & JavaScript concepts.
- I continued making progress on the Tribute page project.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Small mobile design for tribute page almost complete, need to create more
  copy/content for the design to work as intended. Not sure if that is a good
  or bad thing. Then will finalized mid and large screen designs and will move
  on to the next project. Almost there! I think. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Day 16: Monday, April 6, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- I'm still playing around with the design of the Tribute page.
- I realized today that the idea I had breaks down when a user has their font
  size adjusted in the browser settings. I need to rethink and probably simplify.
- Did some reading: Cracking the Coding Interview ‚Äî Chapter 2.

#### **Thoughts:**

- A bit frustrated that I didn't make more progress today.
- Not the best mental health today. Stress levels high. Breathing in, breathing
  out. Dealing.

### Day 21: Saturday, April 11, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- More work on survey form: passed remaining tests; began styling.

### Day 22: Sunday, April 12, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Continued working on Survey Form project, tweaking the form styling into
  something that looks good.

#### **Thoughts:**

- I like the direction it's heading in, but it still needs more work.
- I may have went overboard with the CSS reset I used, but it's forcing me to
  learn more about the concerns involved with styling input/form components.

### Day 23: Monday, April 13, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Continued working on Survey Form project, more form styling.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Styling long text for checkboxes proving to be tricky.
- Making hit targets larger (extending full length of line) for short button
  text also seems to be tricky.
- Hoping to finsih this project tomorrow and move on to the next one.

### Day 24: Tuesday, April 14, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Today was a codeless day.
- Spent time watching and supporting freeCodeCamp's Lockdown Conference.
- Spent time learning about CSS positioning (position: relative|absolute|fixed|static).
- Spent time examining sites that use the CSS fixed position elements.
- Spent time on job search items.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Will get back on track and into code tomorrow.

---

### Day 25: Wednesday, April 15, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Jumped back to the Tribute Page project for a change of pace.
- Because I was spending time deep diving into forms and accessibility I
  decided to look back on my Tribute Page project with accessibility in mind.
- Managed to find and fix a few issues using the W3C Validation and the AChecker
  Services.
- Used TalkBack on my Pixel 2 to navigate the page checking the screenreader
  experience, and managed to tweak a few things based on that.

#### **Thoughts:**

- I need to keep Accessibility in mind as part of the build and testing process
  going forward.

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Ran across this [Build a PAC-MAN game in JS, HTML, and CSS game project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeUGlSl2i4Q) today.
- Followed along with tutorial, but in the end made many tweaks and additions to the logic and style.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Today was a guilty pleasure day. Tomorrow back to freeCodeCamp curriculum projects.

### Day 27: Friday, April 17, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Switched back to working on the freeCodeCamp Survey Form project.
- Still trying to nail down a decent basic design that I like.
- Wrestling with styling the form controls, the CSS reset I used knocked out a lot of the visual look of controls.
- Looking at this as an opportunity to better get to know what goes into the styling of form inputs.

#### **Thoughts:**

- This project has been dragging out, but I'm proud of myself for just sticking with it, even through all of the
  back and forth on the design decisions.
- Not all projects are fun and games or super interesting, but still have to see them through to the end...
- Hopefully, that end will be soon for this one. LOL

### Day 28: Saturday, April 18, 2020

#### **Today's Progress**:

- Re-created the CSS from scratch taking a more organized approach.

#### **Thoughts:**

- Passing all tests and looking pretty good, so I'm calling this project finished.
- Form can use a little more Portlandia visuals and more inside jokes. Keeping this note as a future project.
- Moving on to next freeCodeCamp project tomorrow.
